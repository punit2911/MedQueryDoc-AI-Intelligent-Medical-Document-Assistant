# 🩺 Medical Document Intelligence Chatbot (LLaMA-2)

## 📌 About the Project

This project is an AI-powered **medical document question-answering system** built using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **vector-based information retrieval**. It enables users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers derived from medical PDF documents.

The system works by loading and splitting PDF documents into smaller chunks, generating vector embeddings using a Hugging Face embedding model, and storing them in **Pinecone**, a scalable vector database. During inference, user queries are matched against relevant document chunks using similarity search, and responses are generated using **LLaMA-2** through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **LLMs + LangChain + Vector Databases** for real-world AI applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

---

## ⚙️ Installation Steps

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama-2.git
cd Medical-Chatbot-using-Llama-2
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

> If Conda is installed:

```bash
conda create -p ./venv python=3.10 -y
conda activate ./venv
```

> Or using Python venv:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔐 API Key Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Pinecone credentials:

```ini
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ Note: Pinecone no longer requires an environment variable (`PINECONE_API_ENV`) in the new SDK.

---

## 📄 Add Medical Documents

Create a `data/` folder in the project root and add your PDF files:

```
data/
├── medical_doc_1.pdf
├── medical_doc_2.pdf
```

---

## 🧬 Index Documents into Pinecone

Before running the chatbot, index the documents:

```bash
python store_index.py
```

This step:

* Loads PDFs
* Splits text into chunks
* Generates embeddings
* Stores vectors in Pinecone

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
